====================================
Web Disable Export and Delete Button
====================================

This module makes the actions 'Export' and 'Delete' (visible on the list view of each model under Actions drop-down) enabled only for the users that have
the Export Button / Delete Button group checked.

A superuser (admin) always sees the Export and Delete buttons.


Usage
=====

Enable the group "Export Button" to the users who are allowed to
make use of the option 'Export' and the "Delete Button" to the users allowed to delete records.


Credits
=======

Original idea from module web_disable_export_group by Onestein,
reviewed and modified for v11 by InfoTerra.
